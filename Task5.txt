Q1. Explain the Z-index with a code example?

Answer -

Z-index : The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or 
          flex and grid items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller 
          one.

          * The stack level of the box in the current stacking context.
          * Whether the box establishes a local stacking context.

          ex - z-index: auto;
